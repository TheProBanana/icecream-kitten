# icecream-kitten

Icecream-kitten is my attempt at learning python by making a very simple "Artificial Intelligence". That is to say, I know the basics of how AIs learn, but know nothing on how to implement that or even start it. So i'm going to attempt to make an escape room where the computer tries to escape in anyway possible.
